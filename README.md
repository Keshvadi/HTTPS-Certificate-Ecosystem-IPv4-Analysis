# HTTPS Certificate Ecosystem: Analyzing the Entire IPv4 Address Space

This research project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of the TLS certificate ecosystem used in HTTPS by exploring the entire IPv4 address space. The project aims to gain insights into the status, distribution, and management of SSL/TLS certificates, as well as the usage of different TLS protocol versions.

## Abstract

The abstract provides an overview of the project and its key findings. It highlights the measurement methodology, the number of hosts and certificates collected, and the major observations made during the analysis. It emphasizes the significance of the study in understanding internet security and the implications for certificate management practices.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the collected data, including SSL/TLS certificates and related information.
- `scripts/`: Includes the scripts used for data collection, parsing, and analysis.
- `results/`: Contains the analysis results, including statistical summaries, graphs, and comparisons with previous studies.
- `references/`: Contains relevant literature and references used in the project.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, instructions, and information for replication.

## Replication

To replicate the study or use the scripts for further analysis, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/HTTPS-Certificate-Ecosystem-IPv4-Analysis.git`
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Review the scripts in the `scripts/` directory to understand the data collection, parsing, and analysis process.
4. Use the provided data in the `data/` directory or conduct your own measurements using the specified methodology.
5. Execute the scripts as per your requirements, ensuring you have the necessary permissions and access rights.
